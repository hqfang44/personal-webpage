Hi! I'm an AI researcher in the Fu Lab at the Department of Chemistry, University of Washington. I'm also an undergraduate student at the University of Washington, with double majors in Computer Science and Statistics. I am fortunate to be advised by Professor Dan Fu in the Fu Lab. My research interests are in computer vision and deep learning. I am interested in building AI tools that are broadly useful and robust. Recently, I am leading the development of CellBacTrack.

Since 2020, I have been conducting research with a research team from Shanghai Jiao Tong University during high school. I also spent several years self-learning AI knowledge, including machine learning, deep learning, computer vision, and natural language processing, through Coursera and hands-on projects.
